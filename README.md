## Abstract

Montreal is the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada with highest number of deaths. The cumulative numbers of cases and deaths in the 33 areas of Montreal are modelled through bivariate hierarchical Bayesian models using Poisson distributions. The Poisson means are decomposed in the log scale as the sums of fixed effects and latent effects. The areal median age, the educational level, and the number of beds in long-term care homes are included in the fixed effects. To explore the correlation between cases and deaths inside and across areas, three bivariate models are considered for the latent effects, namely an independent one, a conditional autoregressive model, and one that allows for both spatially structured and unstructured sources of variability. As the inclusion of spatial effects change some of the fixed effects, we extend the Spatial+ approach to a Bayesian areal set up to investigate the presence of spatial confounding.
